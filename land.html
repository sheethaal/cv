<p><font face="Rockwell" size="5" color= "FF3C08">This ride is an absolute must for every guest visiting FUNTASTICA. A bogie that resembles a raft made of logs is hauled up a hill using a conveyor and taken through a tunnel. On emerging from the tunnel, it hurtles down a steep incline at a dizzying speed and splashes into a shallow pool, sending a glorious spray of water your way and drenching you in the process. This fun ride is suitable for all riders in all the age groups.
