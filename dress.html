<p>In the interest of safety of the guests and hygiene at various rides, strict dress code is enforced in our parks</p>
<p>-Apparel made of 100% Nylon or synthetic material (t-shirts, shorts, bermudas, three-fourths, or swim suits) only will be allowed at the water rides including Rain Disco & Wavepool</p>
<p>-Sarees, churidars/salwars, dupatta, formal pants, shirts, burkhas/purdahs, school uniforms, denims (jeans and three-fourth jeans), cargos etc. are not permitted in the water rides. </p>
<p>-Almost all our rides involve motion/ moving parts. To avoid potential risk of any accidents, we request all our guests to refrain from wearing long or loose garments like Saree/Dupatta/ Shawls/Scarves/ Hijab/Mafta/Habit etc. in any of the rides.</p>
<p>In case you are not wearing or carrying garments that fit the bill, we have alternative arrangements. You could purchase Nylon/Synthetic clothes at stores in the park near changing room/locker area at a nominal price starting Rs. 100/-</p>
